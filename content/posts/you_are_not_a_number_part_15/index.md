## An open invitation to The Advancement

I've been working on solving the problem of advertising and digital identity for close to a decade.
I've released things in fits and starts just trying to get people on board with the idea of not putting their birthdays into random online forms.
But the road to progress is always winding.

Then on January 20th, four smiling billionaires, and two Nazi salutes, and the subsequent fellating of these dickheads by "entrepreneurs," and wallstreet bros, gives a very simple entry point into doing something. 

This isn't a political thing, and it isn't an American thing.
Regardless of who you are, wanting a world where your every online action isn't spied upon shouldn't be controversial. 

So let's focus on that for like a year. 
We'll be back to fighting about politics soon enough, but before that let's take these billionaires down a peg.

I call the group who does this, The Advancemet, and everyone, except for actual Nazis, are invited.
All you have to do is install a browser extension, and/or download an app.
Those of us in The Advancement who make those things, will take it from there.
And you can spend your time doing whatever you love to do, and not have to worry about billionaires in your bedroom.

[^1]: "auth is short for authentication (authn) and authorization (authz). The former establishes who you are, and the latter establishes that you are able to do what you're trying to do. I like writing about auth, which is why I'm going to leave this as a footnote, and not add fifty paragraphs to this post."

[^2]: "Elwood was paid not one, but two cool Benjamins for his recording of perhaps the most well-known voice acting of the 90s."

[^3]: "If you make your money from ads, I've got no beef with you. The ad-dispensing companies have made it their mission to encroach on your creative space as much as possible to extract value from your hard work. I'm here to help carve out a path to you making more money in addition to how you use the ad networks."

[^4]: "When Google created a parent company Alphabet, Alphabet dropped the don't be evil. The don't be evil line moved to Google's code of conduct. I wanted to avoid inferring anything from this, but when you change something like don't be evil to anything else, it's worth a questioning glance."

[^5]: "I told you not to look it up"

[^6]: "This story is a little different than what I've represented here, and this is mostly based on my recollection of the film the Social Network, which was itself inaccurate, but I don't much care. Facebook is the largest deseminator of disinformation on the planet, and I'm not too worried about them getting a turn."

[^7]: "Yes there are plenty of bank fees, and some accounts do have monthly fees, but those are largely just because banks are dicks"

[^8]: "So banks don't hold a lot of cash, because cash is better used in investments. So to handle their day-to-day operation they borrow money for really short terms (like for a day) from money market funds. They pay this back with a small amount of interest, and that gets paid to the investors in the money market. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, the debt it owed to the money market represented money that was effectively gone."

[^9]: "These jamokes reneged on so many dumb promises this time, but the one that I think just really sums it all up is Haven, the healthcare venture that Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos started to fix healthcare. It shudown unceremoniously in 2021, after doing nothing. The second richest man on Earth just gives up after a couple of years, because something's too hard, what a ballsack."

[^10]: "At the time, all Starbucks employees were granted stock options, and thus the company referred to its employees as 'partners'."

[^11]: "Both The Fediverse, and Bluesky are implementations of distributed systems based on underlying protocols. The Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol, and thus The Fediverse, came first, but despite the first-mover advantage, lags behind Bluesky these days in user adoption. The reason for this is a combo of marketing and usability, and definitely outside of the scope of this footnote."

[^12]: "There are, of course, things that are so heinous, that even if they're aren't illegal in the uploader's juristiction it will result in excommunication."
