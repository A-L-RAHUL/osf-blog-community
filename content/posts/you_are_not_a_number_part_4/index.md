# Part 4 - Looking for my space

## Humans are social animals right?

Somewhere in the early aughts, my friend bought the domain mauledbytigers.com and set up a message board. 
The only significant world event I can remember circulating on the board was the Mr. Hands video, an event that if you do not know about I highly suggest you do not look up.[^5]
That event happened in 2005, so that gives you the year.

I was known as Lazer back in those days, and part of the Chicago music scene. 
It was a big scene, and my contribution largely insignificant, but I did meet a lot of people, and there are more than a few who know me as Lazer to this day.
The problem, of course, was how to keep up with all of these friends. 

Luckily tech had the answer again!

In 2002, an enterprising Canadian named Jonathan Abrams started work on a new social network.
In early 2003 he launched Friendster. 
Friendster introduced a new problem to internet--hyper scaling. 
AOL had topped off around three million users.
A decade later, Friendster would hit 100 million users, and making things work for those many people was a bit of a challenge.

### A thumb on the scale

Friendster was the first, but the two that came next, at least in the states, were the real players to define the social networking era. 
One lives on in my mind as a symbol of freedom and awesomeness, and the other is possibly the most damaging entity on the planet.
Let's start with the former.

![The legendary picture of Tom from MySpace](./tom.jpg)

If you're over a certain age, this image needs no introduction.
When you signed up for MySpace, this was your first friend: Tom from MySpace.
As I write this, tech billionaires are capitulating to right-wing hostility, and endeavoring to make life as hard as possible for everyone other than themselves.
So the fact that Tom sold MySpace for $500 million+, and then just kind of disappeared, is really refreshing.

After Friendster, and MySpace, the Winklevoss Twins had the genius idea of ripping off those websites, but making it exclusive to Harvard students so as to separate themselves from the dirty plebes around them.
They turned to the obviously talented programmer of the website they used to drunkenly rate coeds on campus, and together that braintrust created Facebook.[^6]

A lot has been written on these first hyperscaled social networks, and why Facebook won when the others didn't.
Like with anything else with pontificating pundits, most of it is reductive, and kind of lame.
Let me give you the inside scoop.

MySpace had this amazing feature where you could grab snippets of web code, and paste it onto your home page. 
If you wanted your page to be bubblegum pink with sparkles around the text, and rainbows raining down, all you had to do was paste in some text.
And that's how it should be, because, after all, _it was your fucking space._

From a performance standpoint, this made everything load slow as molasses, and for anyone who hadn't been online ten years ago, made the site pretty unusable. 
Us twenty-somethings were the target demographic, and we loved it, but it left the younger folk kind of uninterested (not that big of a deal).
For the older folk though it left Facebook with the perfect opportunity.

Somebody at Facebook had the critical insight that for most people, and definitely anyone who has left the devil may care time of their lives, their friends just weren't all that interesting.
Instead, using their friends to target shared interests in a timeline feed kept people more engaged. 
And the timeline feed loaded fast, and always had good stuff.

In the world of digital monetization there's a big difference between people in their mid-twenties, and people over thirty-five because the latter has money, and the former doesn't. 

For a brief moment in time, everyone was touching code just a bit to make things fun on the internet. 
It was beautiful, and important, and that shard of collective creativity was shattered by the most boring gray with blue accents bs like the time thieves in Momo. 

Of course, now we know who came out on top--a company who has single-handedly advanced disinformation and destructive rabbit holes in the name of ad-based profit moreso than any entity in history. 

Tom, I wish you the best, but I wish you'd never left.

I like writing about auth, which is why I'm going to leave this as a footnote, and not add fifty paragraphs to this post."

[^2]: "Elwood was paid not one, but two cool Benjamins for his recording of perhaps the most well-known voice acting of the 90s."

[^3]: "If you make your money from ads, I've got no beef with you. The ad-dispensing companies have made it their mission to encroach on your creative space as much as possible to extract value from your hard work. I'm here to help carve out a path to you making more money in addition to how you use the ad networks."

[^4]: "When Google created a parent company Alphabet, Alphabet dropped the don't be evil. The don't be evil line moved to Google's code of conduct. I wanted to avoid inferring anything from this, but when you change something like don't be evil to anything else, it's worth a questioning glance."

[^5]: "I told you not to look it up"

[^6]: "This story is a little different than what I've represented here, and this is mostly based on my recollection of the film the Social Network, which was itself inaccurate, but I don't much care. Facebook is the largest deseminator of disinformation on the planet, and I'm not too worried about them getting a turn."

[^7]: "Yes there are plenty of bank fees, and some accounts do have monthly fees, but those are largely just because banks are dicks"

[^8]: "So banks don't hold a lot of cash, because cash is better used in investments. So to handle their day-to-day operation they borrow money for really short terms (like for a day) from money market funds. They pay this back with a small amount of interest, and that gets paid to the investors in the money market. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, the debt it owed to the money market represented money that was effectively gone."

[^9]: "These jamokes reneged on so many dumb promises this time, but the one that I think just really sums it all up is Haven, the healthcare venture that Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos started to fix healthcare. It shudown unceremoniously in 2021, after doing nothing. The second richest man on Earth just gives up after a couple of years, because something's too hard, what a ballsack."

[^10]: "At the time, all Starbucks employees were granted stock options, and thus the company referred to its employees as 'partners'."

[^11]: "Both The Fediverse, and Bluesky are implementations of distributed systems based on underlying protocols. The Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol, and thus The Fediverse, came first, but despite the first-mover advantage, lags behind Bluesky these days in user adoption. The reason for this is a combo of marketing and usability, and definitely outside of the scope of this footnote."

[^12]: "There are, of course, things that are so heinous, that even if they're aren't illegal in the uploader's juristiction it will result in excommunication."
