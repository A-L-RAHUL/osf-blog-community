# Part 9 - Are you entertained?

## The boob tube

The television was invented in the 1920s.
Its history is long, and interesting, but out of scope for this doc. 
Except for one part. 

In 1941, before a sunny baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Philadelphia Phillies, a brief ad, the first television ad in the US aired. 
It cost $9 (close to $200 today) and aired to about 4,000 people. 
I have no doubt that this would have opened the flood gates regardless of what was going on in the world, but as it would happen 1941 was a rather auspicious year.

On December 7th of 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor launching the United States into a full participant in World War II. 
To produce the kind of war-time provisions needed to fight that war, the government rationed a bunch of things.
Pretty much any large manufacturer was rationed, or flat out bought up, by the government.

For their troubles, the government set up the War Advertising Council.
The council's mandate was to provide free or cheap advertising for these harmed businesses while also supporting the war effort. 
[You can see some of the sweet ads here][oh-the-forties-were-a-looong-time-ago].

The WAC, an auspicious acronym given their mandate, was essentially the propaganda engine for the war effort, but because it was American, it made sure to sell tires alongside white picket fences, and obedient dames for when you got home.

When the war ended, the US stood as pretty much the only industrial power not bombed significantly, and a bunch of twenty-somethings came home with cash in their pockets.
The WAC disbanded, companies started producing again, and all they had to do was replace uniforms with suits, and they had their advertising ready to go. 
Print, film, and radio were all known mediums, but one of the things all those soldiers were buying were tvs--the perfect new medium for companies looking to reach an audience. 

It didn't take long before one of the largest marketing firms in the country ACNielsen realized that advertisers would benefit from, and thus pay them for information about who was watching what.
To do this they went to a couple of towns in America, and had the good people there write down what shows they were watching. 
And this is how tv ratings worked for almost four decades, until cable joined the party.

With cable, Nielsen was able to make a box.
You could attach this box in between your cable and your tv, and it would record what you were watching for Nielsen.
For your troubles, Nielsen would pay you a couple bucks, and sell your demographic data and viewing habits for a bit more than those couple of bucks.

### The searchlights

I was maybe twelve years old when the family was driving home from some dinner at some American suburban culinary stalwart, when we saw the hollywood spotlights scanning the skies near our house. 
Intrigued, we ventured over to the grand opening of the hottest chain sweeping the nation in in the first half of the nineties: Blockbuster Video. 
We of course had a perfectly fine video rental shop we already frequented, but Blockbuster was new and shiny, and closer to home, so we were hooked.

Blockbuster had a novel instrument for us--the Blockbuster card. 
At our local rental shop, you'd just leave your name, and they'd put you into their ancient phosphorescent green machine, and you'd be on your way.
Blockbuster had UPCs and scanners, and a laminated wallet-stuffer you could use to show people you were cool.

Prior to Blockbuster, there were some retailers which collected customer data into a nationwide database, but nothing that came close to Blockbuster's reach. 
At its peak, Blockbuster had close to a fifth of the US as members, all just givin' away when they rented War of the Roses four weekends in a row to get through a breakup.

Of course Blockbuster would blunder the world's transition from physicial to digital media, and Netflix would pick up the ball. 
What Blockbuster was doing with your rental habits seems lost to the ages, but Netflix has partnered with Nielsen to provide that information at the very least. 

And there you go, your tv too, just spying on you for advertisers to sell you more stuff.

I like writing about auth, which is why I'm going to leave this as a footnote, and not add fifty paragraphs to this post."

[^2]: "Elwood was paid not one, but two cool Benjamins for his recording of perhaps the most well-known voice acting of the 90s."

[^3]: "If you make your money from ads, I've got no beef with you. The ad-dispensing companies have made it their mission to encroach on your creative space as much as possible to extract value from your hard work. I'm here to help carve out a path to you making more money in addition to how you use the ad networks."

[^4]: "When Google created a parent company Alphabet, Alphabet dropped the don't be evil. The don't be evil line moved to Google's code of conduct. I wanted to avoid inferring anything from this, but when you change something like don't be evil to anything else, it's worth a questioning glance."

[^5]: "I told you not to look it up"

[^6]: "This story is a little different than what I've represented here, and this is mostly based on my recollection of the film the Social Network, which was itself inaccurate, but I don't much care. Facebook is the largest deseminator of disinformation on the planet, and I'm not too worried about them getting a turn."

[^7]: "Yes there are plenty of bank fees, and some accounts do have monthly fees, but those are largely just because banks are dicks"

[^8]: "So banks don't hold a lot of cash, because cash is better used in investments. So to handle their day-to-day operation they borrow money for really short terms (like for a day) from money market funds. They pay this back with a small amount of interest, and that gets paid to the investors in the money market. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, the debt it owed to the money market represented money that was effectively gone."

[^9]: "These jamokes reneged on so many dumb promises this time, but the one that I think just really sums it all up is Haven, the healthcare venture that Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos started to fix healthcare. It shudown unceremoniously in 2021, after doing nothing. The second richest man on Earth just gives up after a couple of years, because something's too hard, what a ballsack."

[^10]: "At the time, all Starbucks employees were granted stock options, and thus the company referred to its employees as 'partners'."

[^11]: "Both The Fediverse, and Bluesky are implementations of distributed systems based on underlying protocols. The Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol, and thus The Fediverse, came first, but despite the first-mover advantage, lags behind Bluesky these days in user adoption. The reason for this is a combo of marketing and usability, and definitely outside of the scope of this footnote."

[^12]: "There are, of course, things that are so heinous, that even if they're aren't illegal in the uploader's juristiction it will result in excommunication."
