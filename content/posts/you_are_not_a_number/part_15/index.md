# Part 15 - You're invited

## An open invitation to The Advancement

I've been working on solving the problem of advertising and digital identity for close to a decade.
I've released things in fits and starts just trying to get people on board with the idea of not putting their birthdays into random online forms.
But the road to progress is always winding.

Then on January 20th, four smiling billionaires, and two Nazi salutes, and the subsequent fellating of these dickheads by "entrepreneurs," and wallstreet bros, gives a very simple entry point into doing something. 

This isn't a political thing, and it isn't an American thing.
Regardless of who you are, wanting a world where your every online action isn't spied upon shouldn't be controversial. 

So let's focus on that for like a year. 
We'll be back to fighting about politics soon enough, but before that let's take these billionaires down a peg.

I call the group who does this, The Advancemet, and everyone, except for actual Nazis, are invited.
All you have to do is install a browser extension, and/or download an app.
Those of us in The Advancement who make those things, will take it from there.
And you can spend your time doing whatever you love to do, and not have to worry about billionaires in your bedroom.
