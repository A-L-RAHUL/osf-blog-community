# Part 11 - Then there were nazis

## Getting creative

A surprising amount of the way I interpret the world comes from playing the original Final Fantasy when I was like six or seven lol.
When you start that game, you select four characters, and you give them a name. 
Your entry point into this world is this ontological decision about who you are, and who is coming along with you. 

Voice acting ruined this subtle yet powerful notion. 
_I_ was no longer the protagonist in my game, and my party was no longer my friends. 
I was just a passenger on a ride packaged up for me in design studios around the world--still fun to be sure, but missing just that little something.

I talked much earlier about handles, and how I've had different ones over the years. 
In games like these I could have the same handle, and be different things. 
Zach the fighter, Zach the paladin, and Zach the, ahem, treasure hunter, each had different incredible adventures. 

The whole of the digital realm I could be whomever or whatever I wanted.
Companies could give me structure to fit myself into, or some lack of structure to explore.
The notion that you had to be yourself was so anathema that you would never even dream of sharing personal information in some random chat room. 

You'd drop into a chat room, get bombarded with "asl," and only fools would actually drop the correct answers to those questions. 
And in this way the creepy old men would self-select by "being" totally legal teen women who would go off together and have criminally unsatisfying lesbian cybersex. 

And the rest of us who weren't there because nudey pics still downloaded too slowly were the most interesting group of philosophers, scientists, inventors, artists, and writers ever assembled--it didn't matter that in real life we were whatever we were, and we didn't have to share our phone numbers to get there.
That's what the internet's for goshdarnit!

I want this back.

### The frontlines

In 2018, the EU passed the first real protections against the incredible spying apparatus the internet had become.
Probably the most noticable thing it did from a day-to-day perspective is that it makes websites which use cookies to track you have to disclose that they do so, and make them opt-in.
How many of y'all know how that works, and what you should opt-in to?
How many of you care to learn?

I'll give you two guesses as to who the biggest provider of cookie-based tracking is.

And here's how that tracking works. 
Google and Meta each give you a number.
Every time you log in to anything anywhere, you're given another number.

Then Google and Meta spend billions and billions of dollars making sure that they can tie the second number to the first. 
Then that first number is given some set of lifetime-values: the amount of money you're likely to spend based on your demographics, and your personality, all of which they know because they've been spying on you since the first time your mouse clicked login.

And somewhere, deep in the bowels of a network you're not invited to, they've added those two numbers together, and probably handed it off to all the governments that they regularly break the regulations of with impunity. 
I don't know what this number looks like, but in computers we have these things called universal unique identifiers (UUIDs), and they look like this: C6B20666-6AF4-4DF6-AB57-8F47A429D415. 

And that's what you and I are: C6B20666-6AF4-4DF6-AB57-8F47A429D415, just a hexadecimal number, followed around the internet by the largest corporations the Earth has ever known. 

Against this there are browsers blocking trackers like Firefox and even Safari, browser extensions fighting back like Privacy Badger and ClearURLs, platforms like signal and matrix for messaging, ad blockers like UBlock, DuckDuckGo for search, Protonmail for email, OpenStreetMap for maps, self-hosted cloud apps you can run in your house. 

These are the projects on the frontlines of this battle. 
Please check them out and give them your support.

### Fuckin' nazis

My dad's favorite movie is Patton. 
The movie begins with the incomporable George C. Scott's rendition of the titular general's speech to the third army in advance of the allied invasion of France. 
It's a good speech.

I remember watching it as a kid, one of those memories that's not really continuous with anything else, just some moment you remember for some reason or another.
There's a part where Scott's Patton says, "we're going to hold them by the nose, and kick them in the ass!" and my dad turned to me and said, "that's really what he did. His army would hold the front, and then attack the rear."

And so when the richest man on Earth threw a nazi salute up at the inauguration of the president that my dad tried to overthrow the government for it hit a bit personally.
My dad may have forgotten about the war that his dad fought in, but hearing about it left an impression on me.

So I figured what worked for Patton, might just work for me, and I got to work on the kick them in the ass part.

The specifics of the work are far too much to go into here, but the gist of it is this: build a system that

a) allows for monetization that isn't ad-based
b) allow users to proliferate their digital identities
c) mess with existing notions of identity

For now, I'll just ask that you take my word on a). 
It's obviously quite important, but again too big for here.

For b) we already know the model, but we have a lot more computing horsepower to go along with it.
You just bring back the handle--Ramdatooki, zweibel, and zkpunk can all live again. 
And why don't we throw in anonymity alongside pseudonymity. 

Of course websites aren't just going to switch to handles overnight, and remembering which ones you used where is impossible, so what if we treated it like a password manager?
And what if we setup a mail server that gave everyone random site-by-site emails that did nothing other than confirm themselves when users signed up for and in to things?
And then, what if we just signed up a few extra users every time you went somewhere, and poked around at some things?

And thinking about that, what if we took all the accounts on social media that people are abandoning because of the nazi thing, and start handing them to people who turn them into zombie bots, and all of a sudden uuids like C6B20666-6AF4-4DF6-AB57-8F47A429D415 started being into different things? 
What happens to the advertising platforms when all of the spying that they rely on suddenly becomes junk, _not_ because we undid 30 years and trillions of dollars worth of spying infrastructure, but because the number that they think we are just isn't us anymore?

I like writing about auth, which is why I'm going to leave this as a footnote, and not add fifty paragraphs to this post."

[^2]: "Elwood was paid not one, but two cool Benjamins for his recording of perhaps the most well-known voice acting of the 90s."

[^3]: "If you make your money from ads, I've got no beef with you. The ad-dispensing companies have made it their mission to encroach on your creative space as much as possible to extract value from your hard work. I'm here to help carve out a path to you making more money in addition to how you use the ad networks."

[^4]: "When Google created a parent company Alphabet, Alphabet dropped the don't be evil. The don't be evil line moved to Google's code of conduct. I wanted to avoid inferring anything from this, but when you change something like don't be evil to anything else, it's worth a questioning glance."

[^5]: "I told you not to look it up"

[^6]: "This story is a little different than what I've represented here, and this is mostly based on my recollection of the film the Social Network, which was itself inaccurate, but I don't much care. Facebook is the largest deseminator of disinformation on the planet, and I'm not too worried about them getting a turn."

[^7]: "Yes there are plenty of bank fees, and some accounts do have monthly fees, but those are largely just because banks are dicks"

[^8]: "So banks don't hold a lot of cash, because cash is better used in investments. So to handle their day-to-day operation they borrow money for really short terms (like for a day) from money market funds. They pay this back with a small amount of interest, and that gets paid to the investors in the money market. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, the debt it owed to the money market represented money that was effectively gone."

[^9]: "These jamokes reneged on so many dumb promises this time, but the one that I think just really sums it all up is Haven, the healthcare venture that Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos started to fix healthcare. It shudown unceremoniously in 2021, after doing nothing. The second richest man on Earth just gives up after a couple of years, because something's too hard, what a ballsack."

[^10]: "At the time, all Starbucks employees were granted stock options, and thus the company referred to its employees as 'partners'."

[^11]: "Both The Fediverse, and Bluesky are implementations of distributed systems based on underlying protocols. The Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol, and thus The Fediverse, came first, but despite the first-mover advantage, lags behind Bluesky these days in user adoption. The reason for this is a combo of marketing and usability, and definitely outside of the scope of this footnote."

[^12]: "There are, of course, things that are so heinous, that even if they're aren't illegal in the uploader's juristiction it will result in excommunication."
