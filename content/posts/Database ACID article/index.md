Implementation of concurrency control and recovery mechanisms
Compliance with ACID Properties:

Atomicity: Atomicity ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed
successfully or rolled back entirely if any operation fails. In MySQL, the default
storage engine InnoDB supports atomicity by implementing transactional features. As
long as you're using InnoDB and managing transactions properly, atomicity should be
ensured.

Consistency: Consistency ensures that the database remains in a consistent state
before and after the transaction. This typically involves enforcing integrity constraints, such as foreign key constraints and check constraints, to maintain data consistency. Proper database design and the use of constraints help ensure consistency.

Isolation: Isolation ensures that the intermediate states of a transaction are not visible
to other transactions until the transaction is committed. InnoDB provides different
isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ) to control the
level of isolation. By default, InnoDB uses the REPEATABLE READ isolation level, which provides a high level of isolation.

Durability: Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are
permanently stored and will not be lost, even in the event of a system failure. InnoDB
achieves durability by writing transaction logs to disk before confirming transaction
commits. As a result, committed transactions are durable.
