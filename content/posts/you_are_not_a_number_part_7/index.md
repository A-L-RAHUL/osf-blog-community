# Part 7 - Just put a coin after it

## What if we just got rid of money?

Little more than a month after Lehman Brothers broke the buck, Satoshi Nakamoto, who may or may not exist, published a whitepaper entitled ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."][bitcoin]
In it he described a system that used asymmetric cryptography, and a new kind of datastore called a blockchain to allow for a transaction system.
In the system, transaction values would be represented by a fungible token called a bitcoin. 

Chances are you've heard of this system.

Bitcoin, and the crypto category it spawned will weave in and out of this story, but this isn't a blog about crypto. 
I introduce it here because Satoshi introduced a third identifier for people: the public key. 

## More bubble?

Now you may be wondering what, if anything, happened to make it so that the bubbles of 2001 and 2008 didn't continue to happen throughout the 2010's.
Well, it turns out there was a crucial asset class that had long gone ignored in the hyper-capitalist United States. 

In 2010, the US Supreme Court passed the Citizens United decision, which decided that the first amendment considered money to be speech, and that there could be no limit on political contributions from institutions.
And you know... politics have been totally cool in the US ever since.

Wherever you stand politically, I hope you can at least recognize the disparity between the US, and other countries' approaches to online protections. 
The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most notable. 
It's what's responsible for those giant cookie banners that show up everywhere on the web.

Without the GDPR, everyone would get to track you without you being none the wiser--just like the gigantocorps would like.
But the GDPR's reach across the pond is limited, and with politics being the cash-hungry beast it is, the gigantocorps coffers wield non-negligible influence around here, and would regardless of who's in charge.
We'll have to wait about a decade for where this really reers its head, but if you're already feeling uneasy, I wouldn't blame you.

[^1]: "auth is short for authentication (authn) and authorization (authz). The former establishes who you are, and the latter establishes that you are able to do what you're trying to do. I like writing about auth, which is why I'm going to leave this as a footnote, and not add fifty paragraphs to this post."

[^2]: "Elwood was paid not one, but two cool Benjamins for his recording of perhaps the most well-known voice acting of the 90s."

[^3]: "If you make your money from ads, I've got no beef with you. The ad-dispensing companies have made it their mission to encroach on your creative space as much as possible to extract value from your hard work. I'm here to help carve out a path to you making more money in addition to how you use the ad networks."

[^4]: "When Google created a parent company Alphabet, Alphabet dropped the don't be evil. The don't be evil line moved to Google's code of conduct. I wanted to avoid inferring anything from this, but when you change something like don't be evil to anything else, it's worth a questioning glance."

[^5]: "I told you not to look it up"

[^6]: "This story is a little different than what I've represented here, and this is mostly based on my recollection of the film the Social Network, which was itself inaccurate, but I don't much care. Facebook is the largest deseminator of disinformation on the planet, and I'm not too worried about them getting a turn."

[^7]: "Yes there are plenty of bank fees, and some accounts do have monthly fees, but those are largely just because banks are dicks"

[^8]: "So banks don't hold a lot of cash, because cash is better used in investments. So to handle their day-to-day operation they borrow money for really short terms (like for a day) from money market funds. They pay this back with a small amount of interest, and that gets paid to the investors in the money market. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, the debt it owed to the money market represented money that was effectively gone."

[^9]: "These jamokes reneged on so many dumb promises this time, but the one that I think just really sums it all up is Haven, the healthcare venture that Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos started to fix healthcare. It shudown unceremoniously in 2021, after doing nothing. The second richest man on Earth just gives up after a couple of years, because something's too hard, what a ballsack."

[^10]: "At the time, all Starbucks employees were granted stock options, and thus the company referred to its employees as 'partners'."

[^11]: "Both The Fediverse, and Bluesky are implementations of distributed systems based on underlying protocols. The Fediverse's ActivityPub protocol, and thus The Fediverse, came first, but despite the first-mover advantage, lags behind Bluesky these days in user adoption. The reason for this is a combo of marketing and usability, and definitely outside of the scope of this footnote."

[^12]: "There are, of course, things that are so heinous, that even if they're aren't illegal in the uploader's juristiction it will result in excommunication."
